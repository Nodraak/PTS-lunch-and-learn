# Introduction
<!-- quick, we already have too many slides -->

### Lagrange Points

* Show GIF
* Earth orbits the Sun
* Orbits are usually faster or slower (depending on the distance), and perturbed by all sorts of forces -> it's chaotic
* Lagrange points rotate at the speed, hence they appear *stationary*

### Why Are Lagrange Points Useful?
<!-- keep it short, go into details later -->

* Observation: Earth, Sun, space
* Communication
* Astronomers like to study the stuff that accumulates there

### People

* Kepler (1571-1630): Kepler's laws on orbital mechanics (1609)
* Newton (1642-1726): Newton's laws of motion (1687)
* Euler (1707-1783): L1, L2, L3 (1722? 1760? 1765?)
* Lagrange (1736-1813): L4, L5 (1772)

### Lagrange's Breakthrough

* 2 body (Earth-spacecraft): easy since Newton
    * Possible to predict in the far future
* 3 body (Sun-Earth-spacecraft): impossible
    * Computers are required for integrating (step by step)

#### Lagrange cheated a bit:
He assumed 2 big body and 1 small in cicular and coplanar orbits (*restricted three-body problem*)
