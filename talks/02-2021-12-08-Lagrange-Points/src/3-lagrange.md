# Lagrange Points

### L1

* Simple (but wrong and confusing) explanation -> Skip if not enough time
* Orbital speed: distance and mass: `v = sqrt(G*M/r)`
* Sun effect on Earth and spacecraft + Earth influence on spacecraft
* Unstable: no natural objects, but spacecrafts can be kept in place with minimal propellant
* Usefulness
    * Observe the Sun or the Earth
    * SOHO, DSCOVR

### L2, L3

* Same as L1
* Fun fact: closer to Sun, but on a higher orbit -> barycenter -> Skip if not enough time
* Usefulness
    * Sun-Earth: observe Space -> JWST
    * Earth-Moon: communication relay - Halo orbit

### L4, L5

* Similar reasoning. But they dont look stable
* With Coriolis, they are stable (move in circles)
* Stable: lots of stuff
    * Sun-Jupiter: Trojans (asteroids)
    * Earth-Moon: Kordylewski clouds (dust)
