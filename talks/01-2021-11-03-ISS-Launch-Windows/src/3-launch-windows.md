# Going to the ISS: Launch Window Constraints

## Launch Date and Time of Crew-3

### Launch Date and Time

#### Successive Launch Date And Time
* Sun Oct 31 06:21 UTC (02:21 local)
* Wed Nov 03 05:10 UTC (01:10 local)

Oddly specific date and time:

* During the night
* During the weekend
* Precision down to the minute

#### The Question
=> Which factors drives a launch date and time?
:::

## Orbital Constraints

### Constraint 1: Inclination

* A given launch site crosses the plane twice a day (instantaneous window)

\pause

* Can afford some misalignment: dogleg maneuver

### Constraint 2: Launch Azimuth (Range Safety)

\pause

* Don't want to fly over Cuba
* ISS is at 51.6Â°N
* Fun fact: Israel launches toward west

### Constraint 3: Orbit Phasing

* Launch when ISS is (approximately) overhead, to reduce phasing time as much as possible
* Inclination is still more important
* Soyuz's fast rendezvous: from 24-48h to 6h to 3h

## Range and Safety Constraints

### Constraint 4: Range Safety (Exclusion Zones)

NOTAM/NOTMAR:

* There could be constraints (visit of the president, a 10 billions $ telescope traveling, ...)

### Constraint 5: Abort Scenarios

\pause

* Constraints in the abort zones
    * Weather
    * Support available - ex: Space Shuttle's TAL abort mode
    * ...

## More Constraints

### Constraint 6: Flight Path and Target Conditions

* Sun: power, temperature
    * Apollo: visibility required the Sun to be very low on the horizon
    * Space Shuttle: thermal control required specific Sun conditions (beta angle)

\pause

* Communication: visibility, antenna handover

### More Constraints

* Launch vehicle
    * Fuel loading/unloading

\pause

* Payload
    * Humans, plants, animals, experiences, ...

\pause

* Weather
    * At launch site, flight path, abort zones
    * Wind, temperature (cf. Challenger), lightning (cf. Apollo 12)
