# Going to the ISS: Launch Windows Constraints

## Orbital Constraints

### Constraint 1: Inclination - Theory

### Constraint 1: Inclination - Summary

* A given launch site crosses the orbital plane twice a day (instantaneous window)

\pause

* Can afford some misalignment: dogleg maneuver

### Constraint 2: Launch Azimuth - Launch Site

* Launch sites:
    * USA: Kennedy Space Center: 28.5째N
    * USSR/Russia: Baikonur Cosmodrome: 46.0째N
* Adjusting the inclination
    * In flight: super expensive
    * From launch:
        * Going lower: very expensive
        * Going higher: (relatively) easy
\pause
* -> ISS is the lowest inclination without overflying China or dropping spent rocket stages in inhabited areas => 51.6째N

### Constraint 2: Launch Azimuth - ISS

\pause

* Don't want to fly over Cuba
* ISS is at 51.6째N
* Fun fact: Israel launches toward west

### Constraint 3: Orbit Phasing - Altitude

* ISS: 370-460 km -> 93 minutes per orbit

### Constraint 3: Orbit Phasing - ISS

\pause

* Launch when ISS is (approximately) overhead, to reduce phasing time as much as possible
* Inclination is still more important
* Soyuz's fast rendezvous: from 24-48h to 6h to 3h

## Range and Safety Constraints

### Constraint 4: Range Safety (Exclusion Zones)

NOTAM/NOTMAR:

* There could be constraints (military exercise, visit of the president, a 10 billions $ telescope traveling, ...)

### Constraint 5: Abort Scenarios

![Source: \cite{CBSNews:abort-exclusion-zones}](abort-exclusion-zone.jpg){width="80%"}

\pause

* Constraints in the abort zones
    * Weather
    * Support available - ex: Space Shuttle's TAL abort mode
    * ...


## More Constraints

### Constraint 6: Flight Path and Target Conditions

* Sun: visibility, temperature, power
    * Apollo: visibility required the Sun to be very low on the horizon
    * Space Shuttle: thermal control required specific Sun conditions (beta angle)

\pause

* Communication: visibility, antenna handover

### More Constraints

* Launch vehicle
    * Fuel loading/unloading

\pause

* Payload
    * Humans, plants, animals, science material, ...

\pause

* Weather
    * At launch site, flight path, abort zones
    * Wind, temperature (cf. Challenger), lightning (cf. Apollo 12)
    * Falcon 9 Crew Dragon Launch Weather Criteria: [link](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/falcon9_crewdragon_launch_weather_criteria_fact_sheet.pdf)
