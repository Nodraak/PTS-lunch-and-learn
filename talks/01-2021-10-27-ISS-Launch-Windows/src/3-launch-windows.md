# Going to the ISS: Launch Windows

## Launch

### Launch Date and Time

![Source: \cite{wikipedia:crew-3-revealed}](spacex-crew-3-revealed.jpg)

* <https://nextspaceflight.com/>
* Odly specific date and time:
    * Sunday 2h21 AM (local)
    * (Very) early Sunday morning

## Orbital Constraints

### Constraint 1: Inclination

* A given launch site crosses the plane twice a day (instantaneous window)

\pause

* Can afford some misalignment: dogleg maneuver

### Constraint 2: Orbit Phasing

* Launch when ISS is (approximately) overhead, to reduce phasing time as much as possible
* Inclination is still more important
* Soyuz's fast rendezvous: from 24-48h to 6h to 3h

## Range and Safety Constraints

### Constraint 3: Range Safety (Exclusion Zones)

**Launch azimuth:**

* Don't want to fly over Cuba
* Fun fact: Israel launches toward west

* There could be constraints (visit of the president, a 10 billions $ satellite traveling, ...)

### Constraint 4: Abort Scenarios

![Source: \cite{CBSNews:abort-exclusion-zones}](abort-exclusion-zone.jpg){width="80%"}

* Abort zones
    * Shannon abort zone
* Constraints
    * Weather
    * Support available - ex: Space Shuttle's TAL abort mode

## More Constraints

### Constraint 5: Flight Path and Target Conditions

* Sun: power, temperature
    * Apollo: visibility required the Sun to be very low on the horizon
    * Space Shuttle: thermal control required specific Sun conditions (beta angle)

\pause

* Communication: visibility, antenna handover
    * USA's DSN
    * ISS control center handover

### More Constraints

* Launch vehicle
    * Fuel loading/unloading

\pause

* Payload
    * Humans, plants, animals, experiences, ...

\pause

* Weather
    * At launch site, flight path, abort zones, target
    * Wind, temperature (cf. Challenger), lightning (Apollo 12)

\pause

* ...
